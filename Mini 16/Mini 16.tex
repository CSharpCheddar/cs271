Answer the following questions and submit a pdf solution to the dropbox on d2l:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Assume that an undirected graph has $V$ vertices. What is the minimum number of edges that must exist in order for there to be a path from a vertex to every other vertex? For example, consider a vertex set of $\{1,2,3,4,5\}$ and an edge set of $(1,2), (4,5)$. In this case, there is no path from $1$ to $5$.
    \begin{center}
    	If $V$ is 0, 0, otherwise $V-1$.
    \end{center}
    \item Assume that an undirected graph has 6 vertices. What is the maximum number of edges that can be in that graph?
    \begin{center}
    	15
    \end{center}
    \item (OPTIONAL) Assume that an undirected graph has $V$ vertices. What is the maximum number of edges that can be in that graph? You should have a formula with respect to $V$.
    \begin{center}
    	If V is 0, 0, otherwise $\sum_{i=0}^{V-1}i$.
    \end{center}
\end{enumerate}
