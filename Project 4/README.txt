This time, I've included the source files. Sorry about not doing that last time. As per your feedback, 
I fixed that equation bug. It was a 10 second fix that took 3 hours to find. It was a simple case of 
using == instead of the .equals() method because I forgot I was using strings for the part. Whoops. 
You can either run the .jar file I've included here, or import the contents of the src folder into 
your favorite IDE, then put the dictionary.txt file wherever your IDE needs you to put it when no 
absolute path is specified. Thank you for allowing me to fix this project up!
